# Match Three


#                                         ---------------------------GAME INFORMATION---------------------------

A simple match three game. The game currently has no animations for the blocks falling and natural matches that occur after new pieces fall and they naturally match.
The game does not have the animations for the human eye to see but the scripts allow for natural matches to occur and refill the board each time.

<br/><br/>

The game also has dynamic grid sizes, the grid can be 5x6, 6x3, 10x10 etc... The developer will simply input the column and row size for the grid and assign an initial 
board state by dragging and dropping pre-existing shapes of the four colors through the inspector, the rest of the process will be automated when matches are made during gameplay. Basically, only the initial board state must be manually set by the developer.
<br/><br/>
#      The shapes can be matched with the following shapes:

<br/><br/>
**3 to 5 vertical or horizontal pieces with the same color**

<br/><br/>

**A "T" shape within any direciton**

<br/><br/>

**A square**

<br/><br/>

**An "L" shape within any direciton**

<br/><br/>
